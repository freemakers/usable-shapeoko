title: "Z-Probe"
---

### Overview

The Z-probe should allow the CNC a known location on the workspace to plunge the tool (when it's turned off!) and find its 0-coordinate. Along with homing switches for X and Y, this should allow the machine to zero itself out before beginning a job. The probe should work regardless of how far the tool protrudes from the Z-axis sled (it should accommodate different tool lengths).

### Notes
