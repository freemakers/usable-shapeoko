# Making Shapeoko Usable for Mere Mortals

The basic Shapeoko 2 kit comes with the parts and instructions necessary to print out the nice little "Shapeoko 2" logo on a piece of paper. It feels really good to see that print out after all the intricate assembly (mine is still hanging on the wall of my shop).

## Now What?

But try to mill anything else, and you have a lot of new problems to solve. How can you design a new part? Once you've designed it, how do you turn it into gcode? How do you even feed the gcode to the mill?

As with many things, all of these questions are easy to answer if you're running Windows and can afford the price of your Shapeoko 2 kit again in software. If you use Linux or want to use open source tools to design your parts, compile gcode, or control your mill, you'll suddenly find yourself alone in the dark.

## Project Purpose

This project will serve primarily as a repository for documentation on how to get Shapeoko 2 running with an open source toolchain, along with a notebook on hardware mods and associated programming that should make the Shapeoko 2 more user-friendly.

Most of this project will be stored in the `gh-pages` branch, which will be used to automatically publish notes and documentation to a generated website on http://freemakers.github.io.
