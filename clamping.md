title: "Clamping & Work-Holding"
---

### Overview

Our goal here is to provide a set of tools for holding down a piece of work as the CNC does its thing. With larger mills, there could be some significant lateral pressure on the work, so for big woodworking jobs we will want some heavier duty clamps. At the same time, we need a different (additional) solution for PCBs, where we will want to mill right out to the ends of the copper clad. There, a small vacuum table solution might work best. This page is meant to capture some of these requirements and ideas.

### Notes

* It would be nice to have a good base system that can stand up to some abuse
* It would also be nice to have add-on vacuum table-type boxes that could be clamped to the main body


### Large Item Holding / Large Work Margins

#### Clamp Designs

* [2-Bolt Slotted Clamp](cad/2-bolt-slotted-clamp.scad) [(STL)](cad/2-bolt-slotted-clamp.stl) - created by John
  * Designed for 1/4"-20 hardware
  * Upside-down carriage bolt as a lever point / spacer
  * Hex head bolt for tightening
    * Threads into t-bolt in wasteboard
  * Knurled work-holding end for better grip / more grip options
  * Rounded ends to limit potential for damage to the work
