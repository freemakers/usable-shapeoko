title: "Homing and Limit Switches"

### Notes

* cheap rocker switches should do the trick
  * not clear what accuracy they provide though
* makerslide provides a natural choice for mounting switches
  * unusable space near the ends where belt tensioners mount
  * needs a mounting plate

### Selections

These are the parts / prints / etc. we're going to try to use. This may change over time if things don't work out.

#### Hardware / Parts:

* [Cheap micro limit switches](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H8TIEHW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

#### Prints:

* [Mounts to axis plates, could be more universal](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:804706)
* [Another plate-mounted switch](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:617617)
  * claims mounting to plates makes wire management easier
* [And another plate-mount design](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:630962)
  * comes with BOM for mounting hardware
